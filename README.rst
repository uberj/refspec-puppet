Refspec puppet
--------------
No puppet modules should be in this repository, instead modules should be added to the ``Puppetfile`` in the root of this project.

Librarian-puppet

All modules are pulled in via ``Puppetfile``\s which are processed by librarian-puppet_. If you make a change to any ``Puppetfile`` you are advised to run ``librarian-puppet install --verbose`` to ensure librarian-puppet can resolve any new dependencies.
